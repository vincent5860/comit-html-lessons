    <h3><em>What is Lorem Ipsum?</em></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and
      typesetting <br />industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
      dummy<br />
      text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley<br />
      of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has<br />
      survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br />
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br />
        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor<br />
        at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
        obscure<br />
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
        the cites<br />
        of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
        Lorem Ipsum comes<br />
        from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
        (The Extremes of Good and <br />
        Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
        of ethics, very popular during<br />
        the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section <br />
        1.10.32.
